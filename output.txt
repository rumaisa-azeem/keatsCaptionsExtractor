Hello. In this video, we'll cover some common form of cyber attacks. So the outline of the session, we're going to cover some common cyber taxes said, mainly as a recap to the previous video. And then we're going to go into a person in the middle family of attacks and then Distributed Denial of Service family of attacks. So the definition again is the, the idea is unauthorised access, modify, disrupt, or damage systems or environments. And really it's to accomplish one of three things, either just access, modification, repudiation, and finally, denial of service. The motivations tend to be either fun, challenge, take advantage from manure intelligence purposes, and, or political gain and cyber terrorism. So we'll start with the simplest of attacks, and that's dumpster diving. It's not limited to searching through beans for obvious treasures like passwords. But it's also about getting phone numbers, names, date of births, lattice addresses, anything that can give the haka. It's sort of the, the initial chain of events. So if they found enough information about a person, they can apply for a passport or a driving licence, send it to someone else. And then of course, start the whole chain of impersonation. Shoulder surfing is another attempt, more commonly known around ATM machines where someone looks over your shoulder for the information. Often the person is looking for the right moment to kind of look over the victim shoulders to get the information. Tailgating again is access to an unauthorised area by shadowing someone who does have approval to get into that area. And impersonation or masquerading as a valid network user. So a social engineer impersonates a valid US over email, telephone, social media. The most recent one was HM, RC, I believe I got plenty of those. And it's effectively trying to impersonate a masquerade as a valid HMAC employee telling you that there is an active case against you. And many people got caught and entered the details into the phone. Backdoor attack. So normally during the development of complicated systems, programme is add back door hooks to kind of help them with maintenance or speedup particular a particular testing. And what normally happens is that those hooks are then used to gain access into the network or the programme and then through that cane and entrance and exploit the system. So these are the top backdoor attacks as, as written by OWASP and some of the more common one or administration and management interfaces that are exposed or redundant interfaces, functions, features that were left and people forgot about them and didn't maintain code, et cetera. Parameters in command line parameters when you execute a programme. Redundant uses authorise third parties if the subcontractors to an organisation, they may have may have been given access in the past that has been revoked, exposed configuration data, et cetera. So we'll move into the person in the middle attack. And this is an attack where by the attacker secretly relays the information between the two parties who actually believed that directly and confidentially communicating with each other. So there are eight common attacks. We'll go through them fairly quickly. The first one is ID spoofing. That is again, done through e-mails, text messages, ID colours, automated services, GPS spoofing was used in Pokemon GO website spoofing. That's the usual, your statement is ready. Click here. Sometimes it's legitimate, sometimes it's not. Ip spoofing is done conducted by creating a packet with four source of IP address for the purpose of hiding the identity of the sender and allows them to impersonate as a, as a different computer system. It's most useful when you look to authentication based IEP systems. If you are a victim of a domain name service spoofing, you may think that you're visiting a safe, trusted website when you're actually interacting with the fraudsters websites. So what happens is they take over your domain name server and either sending your device to a different address, a different IP address than the one that is registered legitimately to that website. And then asks you for the information to login and you lose your credentials that way. The next one is ARP spoofing. So that's an address resolution protocol spoofing. Generally the aim here is the associate, the attackers MAC address of the right of the network out with an IP address of a different host. So it leads DO device to believe that you are communicating with the gateway of the network when in actual fact, you're communicating with the hackers device. So the next one is HTTP spoofing. That's the simplest and potentially the most devastating. So this is, can be conducted by redirecting your browser to unsecure website with similar look. So the attacker monitors your interaction and with the fake websites and steals information. The tactic here is known as Homo graph attack. If you can see in this example, Amazon is spelt with double n. This is normally done with non trivial ascii codes, so that the character looks very similar to what it should be, but it actually is different. Ssl hijacking. So in this attack, the attacker acts as the bridge between your computer and the secure server. They forged the SSL session handshake process and then intercept the information that is passed between you two. Of course, when a victim wants to connect to an SSL, the attacker intercepts that request. And what they do is they downgrade from an SSL to HTTP protocol. And by downgrading it, they then enabling to decrypt the information. So email hijacking is another form of person in the middle in which the hacker compromises and gains access to the target of the e-mail ID of the email account. The hacker then silently monitors some communications between the client, the provider, and uses the information for malicious purposes. Of course, you could wait for an opportune moment. The attacker might send the message from the victim's account to the bank and say, Look, I instruct you to transfer funds, or indeed any other information that would get you to divulge further credentials. Wi-fi eavesdropping. This is also known as evil twin attack. The hacker performs a Wi-Fi eavesdropping in a type that person in the middle tact is normally trick to unsuspecting victim into connecting to a malicious Wi-Fi networks. What happens here is that they normally tend to linger around areas where there is a famous chain and you go or supermarket, a new thinking. You set your device to automatically connect to that network. You connect to that network and then they've got, they are effectively sitting in the middle between you and the websites. Are you contacting and they can eavesdrop and decipher your communications. Stealing browser cookies, for example, an online retailer might store the personal information that you enter into a shopping cart, items that you've selected on into a cookie so that you don't have to re-enter that. Of course, the criminal than hijacks the session. These browser cookies then gain access to password, the dress, and other sensitive information. They sometimes change those credentials and lock you out, and sometimes they just carry on this session depending on what is required. In a session hijacking attack, the haka steals the user's session token and uses that to access to user account. There are several ways Duck be done. It could be through malware, monitors and steals the session data. Another method is of course, cross site scripting that we've discussed. So this is how he might look in reality. We've got the attacker here injecting a script into the server, then the server, the victim authenticates on the server. The server returns the page code, and then the victim is actually communicating with the hacker rather than with the server. Brute force attack. So the attacker systematically cheques all possible passwords and phrases until what the correct one is found. This is known as a dictionary attacks as well because you go through very prescriptive set of passwords, effectively trying all possible combinations until you succeed. Sql injection. So an attacker could carry out an SQL injection, injection simply by submitting malicious code into the vulnerable website search box. That is essentially done because most websites are driven through a web database. And we're going to go through that. This is a good example of how that could happen. So although you haven't gone through SQL yet, we'll go over that in semester 2. In this case, when you're looking for a product, you just select something and attribute from a particular field. And then you say on the condition that the username is something, now that something is translated into PHP in the background into this. Okay? And that means that you don't actually know what the line that was submitted was. So the username could be another request for another SQL so they can actually inject a different SQL query. In the username field. And that's why fields must be validated before they're actually acted on. Finally, we're getting to the Denial of Service family of attacks. So we're starting with the flood attack. An attacker can also use multiple compromise device. To launch this attack, we choose several different places to exhaust the server that we're trying to shut down. We simply exhaust the resources and the bandwidth on the server until it can no longer serve other requests. So common types of volume based attacks, application and protocol. We have a UDP flood or UDP flood by definition is any DDoS attack the floods the target with User Datagram Protocol packets. So the goal here, of course, of the attack is to flood the random port of the remote host. It causes the host to repeatedly cheque for the application that listen on a particular port. And of course, when there's no application is found, you replies with, I see MP, destination, unreachable packet. And of course, but that takes resources. And the more request we inject, the more resources we sap out of the server until it's overwhelmed. The next one is ICMP, similar in principle to UDP. The flood attack and I MCP flood overwhelms the target resources with echo request. So it's a simple ping request that generally sends packet as fast as possible without waiting for a reply. This type of attack can consume both outgoing and incoming bandwidth and the echo reply packets resulting in significant overall system slowdown. Http flood. So what happens with an HTTP flood? The attacker exploits a legitimate HTTP GET and post requests. And the attack is most effective when it forces the server, the web server or the application to locate to allocate maximum number of resources for each request. Now, the problem with that is that it uses very low traffic threshold. And it's normally quite difficult to distinguish between a legitimate HTTP traffic and non legitimate. And often if it's not handled carefully, you can get a lot of false positives, which means that you're losing legitimate traffic to your website. So it's a real headache to, to solve. So slow loris is a highly targeted attack, enabling one webserver to take down another web server without affecting other services or ports in the network. So it does this by holding as many connexions to the target web server open for as long as possible. And the accomplishes this by creating connexion to the target server. So slow loris constantly send HTTP header, but never completes the request. And what happens is that the target server keeps each of these force connexions open until eventually, of course, it runs out of concurrent connexion pool, which leads to a denial of service TCP sync flood. In a TCP sync flood the attack, the attacker exploits unknown weakness in the TPP TCPIP connexion sequence, the three-way handshake. So this is what it looks like. So you initiate as many requests, but nobody answers the sink acknowledgment. And then as those happen, the RAM in the buffer fills up until there's denial of service. Ping of death. Zach involves the attacker sending multiple malformed or malicious pings to the computer. So what happens here? You've got the maximum packet length of an IP packet is around 64 kilobytes. And what happens is when the packet is too big, the serve segments, those into different segments. But of course, if you then inject larger segments when they're being put together by the server and they exceed the 64 K, they end up with overflow. Zero-day exploits. So the definition encompasses all unknown, a new attack exploiting vulnerabilities for which no patches yet been released. The term is well-known amongst the member of the hacker community, where the practise of trading zero-day vulnerability has become a very popular activity. So fishing is the last one you'll be pleased to hear. Well familiar, well known, and that is, it.
